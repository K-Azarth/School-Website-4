                        the most phenomenal assemblage of super-spellers in the history of this competition.” In an historic change to the rules listed on the bee’s website, Bailly then announced that the competition would conclude after 20 rounds, regardless
                        of how many spellers remained. At that point, they would all be declared “co-champions.”</p>

                        adapting by becoming People-Centric instead of being Book-Centric. They become community resources for collaborating, creating, and making.</p>
